Razor Pages is a feature of ASP.NET Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.

* Razor Syntax: Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-based code into webpages. The Razor syntax is a combination of C# and HTML. Pre-existing HTML files can be converted to Razor files by simply changing the file extension from .html to .cshtml (for C#) or .vbhtml (for VB).

* Page Model: Each Razor Page has a companion PageModel. This is a class where you can write server-side code to handle page events, manipulate page data, and so on. The PageModel is similar to a Controller in an MVC application.

* Handler Methods: Handler methods in Razor Pages are methods that are automatically executed when a certain condition is met, such as a page being requested or a form being submitted. They are named according to the convention On<HTTP method> such as OnGet, OnPost, etc.

* Routing: In Razor Pages, routing is based on the file structure inside the Pages folder. The path to a Razor Page file determines the URL at which the page can be accessed.

* Tag Helpers: Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. They are a new feature in ASP.NET Core and make Razor markup more readable and easier to use.

* Layouts: Layouts are used to maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple pages within your web application.

* Partial Views: Partial views are used when you want to reuse a piece of HTML across multiple pages.

* View Imports: The _ViewImports.cshtml file is used to include common Razor directives that you want to be available for all Razor pages in a folder and its subfolders.

* View Start: The _ViewStart.cshtml file is a special Razor Pages file that contains code that will be executed before the code in any other Razor Pages file in the same directory or subdirectories.

* TempData, ViewData, and ViewBag: These are techniques to pass data from the PageModel to the Razor Page and between requests.
